## Session Context

- **Branch:** `feature/darkrepos-wiki`
- **PR:** #75 - Replace Data Crystal with DarkRepos wiki integration
- **Epic:** #7 - DarkRepos Wiki Documentation

## Conversation Summary

### User Request
User requested continuation of wiki work from previous session, specifically:
1. Git commit everything in logical batches
2. Attach commits to issues
3. Update todo lists and GitHub issues
4. Document everything
5. Update internal links to use new folder paths
6. Create game folders for stub pages
7. Update README with wiki structure

### Follow-up Request
User requested folder structure improvement - remove `games.darkrepos.com` nested folder and use a better structure.

## Work Performed

### Phase 1: Template Updates (continued from previous session)
- Updated game index pages to use new `{{Infobox_game}}` template
- Added `{{navbox}}` navigation to game pages
- Updated internal links to use folder-based paths

### Phase 2: Folder Reorganization
Reorganized wiki structure from:
```
Wiki/games.darkrepos.com/Dragon_Quest_III_(SNES)/
```
To:
```
Wiki/SNES/Dragon_Quest_III/
```

Key improvements:
- Removed redundant `games.darkrepos.com/` nesting
- Organized by platform (`NES/`, `SNES/`, `GBA/`)
- Removed `_(Platform)` suffix from game folders
- Moved templates/categories to `_meta/`

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- Deleted orphan wiki files (duplicates from old structure)
- Updated README.md with new structure documentation

## Commits Made

1. `4615d45` - refactor(wiki): reorganize wiki content by platform
2. `be7a11d` - refactor(wiki): remove games.darkrepos.com folder, flatten structure
3. `1aaab0a` - chore: remove orphan Dragon Quest I & II TBL file

## GitHub Updates

- Added progress comment to Epic #7
- All commits reference #7

## Technical Notes

- MediaWiki URL structure: `{Platform}/{Game}/{Subpage}`
- Example: `SNES/Dragon_Quest_III/ROM_Map`
- Templates in `_meta/Templates/`
- Categories in `_meta/Categories/`

## Outstanding Work

- [ ] Verify all internal links updated
- [ ] Test template rendering on actual MediaWiki

| #87 | Data Extraction | ✅ Tool created |
| #91 | ROM Reassembly | ✅ Verified working |
| #92 | Asset Pipeline | ✅ Framework created |
| #93 | Map Viewer | ✅ GUI created |

## Files Committed

### New Disassembly Files (28)
- `disasm/bank04.asm` through `disasm/bank1f.asm`

### New Tools (5)
- `tools/map_extractor.py` - Map data scanning
- `tools/map_viewer.py` - tkinter GUI viewer
- `tools/sprite_extractor.py` - 4BPP sprite extraction
- `tools/data_extractor.py` - Enemy/item data extraction
- `tools/assembler.py` - Basic 65816 assembler

### Extracted Assets
- 32 binary banks at `assets/banks/`
- 2,144 sprite PNGs at `assets/graphics/sprites/`
- Data JSONs at `assets/data/`
- Map scan results at `assets/maps/`

## Statistics

- **Total disassembly**: 468,701 instructions across 32 banks
- **Sprites extracted**: 96 player + 2,048 enemy = 2,144 total
- **Pointer tables found**: 808
- **Map headers found**: 14,985
- **Data tables found**: 29,894
- **Soul Lair entries**: 7,844

## Next Steps

1. Add meaningful symbol labels to disassembly (#84)
2. Improve map viewer to use actual extracted map data
3. Create RAM map documentation (#89)
4. Document data structures (#90)
5. Audio/SPC extraction (#88)
6. Create wiki documentation pages (#79)

## Technical Notes

- ROM rebuild from binary banks verified - only 4-byte difference (checksum bytes at $7fdc-$7fdf as expected)
- Map viewer uses tkinter, displays tilesets but needs actual map data integration
- Sprite extractor handles 4BPP SNES format with grayscale palette

## Session Duration
~30 minutes (continuation session focused on git/issue management)

## Key Findings

### Mesen2 Pansy Export
The `pansy-export` branch has comprehensive documentation:
- Full implementation of PansyExporter class
- Menu integration in debugger
- Config option for auto-export
- Supports all platforms (NES, SNES, GB, GBA, etc.)
- Exports symbols, comments, CDL data, jump targets, subroutines

### Phase 2-4 Roadmap Items
- Testing & validation (target: 2026-01-20)
- Enhanced data export (memory regions, cross-refs)
- Performance optimizations (compression, incremental updates)

## Next Steps

1. **Create CDL/Symbol Workflow Documentation**
   - How to use Mesen2 to document ROM while playing
   - Export workflow for Pansy files
   - Integration with Peony/Poppy

2. **Create GitHub Issues**
   - Mesen2 Pansy integration testing
   - game-garden roundtrip verification
   - subrom improvements

3. **Test Pansy Export**
   - Load ROM in Mesen2
   - Play game to generate CDL data
   - Export Pansy file
   - Verify with Pansy viewer

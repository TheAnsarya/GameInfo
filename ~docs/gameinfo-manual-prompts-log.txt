git commit all files in logical groups and update git issues (or make git issues and then update them)

#directives: make a directives file and use it: For the GameInfo project; Our home folder is `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo`; turn on github issues for the project (and make a github project that is always associated with all github issue tracking work and kanban board), during this planning process, and when planning or making new un-planned work, always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files; At the end of every prompt-response please include a "what's next" section or what's left to do or an example prompt for what we should do next; research and create all the details for each epic issue; update the epics with sub-issues for every detail and sub-effort; `~docs` is for documentation about *making* the project while `docs` is for information about the project itself; make a bunch of github issues and todo-lists for what we're doing with this project; then make a SCRUM board for the issues and make issues and todo-lists and epics for everything we're planning to do to to make this project complete; Remember, file addresses and ROM/code addresses are not always the same; make a ton of documentation about the project; make sure all documentation is reachable from `README.md` in the link-tree and organize all documentation of the project and game in the `docs` folder organized into subfolders by subject or system; please go back and reformat, but all hexadecimal values in code should be lowercase, `$9d` not `$9D` or not `0xCA6E` but rather `0xca6e`; tabs not spaces!; git commit as we go; make sure all issues are tied to a parent issue up to the epics; use labels that have actual meanings, don't use abbreviations in labels for the code; extract all the assets that you can and use `.include`s for all graphics, and stats, and text and dialog and data structures, and effects, and for the build pipeline with transformations to json/png/etc; git commit and push in logical groups, always git commit at the right time; everything should use the `.editorconfig` file, especially the fact that we use TABS not spaces, always tabs, fix all our files, python, py, json, etc., always use tabs!; continue; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; ****Main purpose:**** create Data Crystal `*.wikitext` files (ROM map, RAM map, data structures, systems descriptions, ) for a bunch of SNES, NES, and other games, and `*.md` documentation for these games, and disassemblies when we can -- usually as external github repos (`ffmq-info`, `dw4-info`, `dragon-warrior-info`) [with documentation, disassembly, and editors], and a complete rom file verification and separation (header, actual rom) utility; create and update github issues and todo-lists for all work; edit this whole prompt into a directives file and associate it with this AI chat in VSCode and clean it up to be in the correct format; go!

it looks like the chat-log is some kind of summary, instead of a chat log, fix it, log the chat, by date, log it!!; git commit all files in logical groups and update git issues (or make git issues and then update them), do this constantly; the `.\tools\` folder has 161 tools in it, move them into sub-folders and organize them by type or system, document all of the tools (`*.md` files); make a meta-tool that links to all of the other tools or uses them directly; and then continue work; continue; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; Hey! Don't use python for scripting, use C# dotnet, the most recent versions and convert all the python scripts to c# dotnet;

update, actually create the chat logs, and then continue;

git commit everything in logical batches, update giuthub issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; ***format*** all of the c# code and other files using the `.editorconfig` for instance, open braces should be at the end of the last line, not on their own line; make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet and c# and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!) and make sure unicode support is universal and comment and document all the code and tools and tests, and fix the mispelling of `Lables` in the code; continue

merge `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.editorconfig` into our `.editorconfig` so we especially have proper c# formatting rules; also update our `gitignore` file to handle c# dotnet projects (maybe reference: `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.gitignore`); continue

make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet (10) and c# (14) and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!, spans, collection expressions, etc); make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

please note the time at the beginning of every query and response so I know when stuff happens, I don't want to be rate limited despite paying money, so I need to know the time; continue, but avoid being rate-limited (are we really doing that much?)

enhance the map editor

update chat logs and session logs for all of our work, not just the map editor; update documentation and github issues and plan more with gh issues and continue tool editing, and create and update todo-lists; git commit and push all uncommited files in logical batches, attach them to issues; always attach commits to a github issue; continue;

continue

do that full `what's next`:; Disassembler UI improvements; Script Editor control flow visualization; CHR Editor multi-tile selection improvements; Map Editor tileset loading, layer support; Keyboard shortcuts throughout UI; continue

do the entire `GameInfo` project and the `dragon-warrior-4` project

there is too much indentation using spaces in the code and documentation, always use tabs, never use spaces unless the file-format requires it, tabs! see the selected portion of `cdl-format.md` as an example of what should be tabs not spaces;

suppress formatting error `MD010/no-hard-tabs` for `*.md` files, which is nonsense; continue;

*************** THIS:

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; ***create documentation for all of the recent work in the `\docs\` folder***; create github issues and todolists, and plans for build pipelines for [SNES, NES, Genesis, etc], with compilers and asset integration (convert assets from ROM data/code to json/png/etc, to an editable state, edited versions, and then convert back to rom data) with configuration files so we can set up any game to be compiled from source and assets; and then implement it; continue;

continue;

make the terminal readable, currently most of the text is invisible (color and background coolor the same) so fix that, and I'm tired of asking, make this change permanent; code format all files, especially c# files, so braces are on the right line, always use tabs not spaces, hexadecimal values are always lowercase; use the most modern code practices; use the most modern libraries and code and language and platform; continue build pipeline platform work updating github issues and todo-lists; continue;

hexadecimal values are always lowercase; continue;

There are a ton of files that need a `git commit` where the files are moved, do that code management; continue making this have universal code documentation and editing app; continue;

Add automatic ROM analysis → wiki page generation; Add wikitext export to CHR Editor (tile/sprite documentation); Add wikitext export to Map Editor (map data documentation); Enhance Wiki Editor with more game-specific templates; continue;

create new branches for each issue/epic/effort and then merge them to main when they are done and remove the old branches that are complete; Add Data Crystal upload integration BUT DO NOT upload anything, Data Crystal forbids AI generated articles so every page needs to be manually reviewed and edited before it can be uploaded, you will get us banned if we don't manually review every article (update the documentation to reflect this fact) But once the review/edit is done, easy upload and compare and getting changes from other people from Data Crystal, is necessary; Make a UI for pushing to Data Crystal and pulling changes and how to implement those thoses in the wikitext generation process (a custom element or changes component or something?); plan and make github issues and todo-lists for this and every work effort; git commit as needed;

Add unit tests for the Wiki project (optional but recommended); Test against Data Crystal when ready to upload content; Merge to main when ready: git checkout main && git merge feature/data-crystal-integration; Delete feature branch after merge: git branch -d feature/data-crystal-integration; continue;

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; continue;

Build Pipeline,

you're supposed to always be working in a branch for each issue 

Continue with other Build Pipeline issues (#58 SNES, #59 Genesis, etc.)

&&&
Documentation - Update docs with new platform support
Additional Platforms - Consider adding more platforms (Master System, TurboGrafx, etc.)
Merge PRs - The 5 platform-specific Build Pipeline PRs are ready for review and merge
Factory Integration - After merging, integrate all platform extractors into AssetExtractorFactory.TryGetPlatformExtractor()
BuildPipelineService Enhancement - Wire up the platform extractors to the build pipeline
&&&

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; use c# not python for all scripts an tools; pick some random github issues and work on them; continue;
continue;

why are you doing a rebase? finish it or cancel it or what

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; after that: you just made a bunch of python scripts, but editors and such should all be c# 14 dotnet 10 code and incorporated into the main application and documented and make sure everything is associated with a github issue and todolist and git commits should be associated with an issue too and make documentation; fix linting errors/warnings in `*.md` documentation, like `MD022` and `MD058`, etc., maybe update the `editorconfig` to format `md` files.; continue; 

you just deleted a bunch of python files instead of commiting them as I asked, can you undo that delete, commit them, and then convert them to c# as I asked you to? and then continue;

Implement remaining tools from issue #68; Add unit tests for the new services; Create ViewModels/Views to integrate into the Avalonia UI;

first: git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; second: implement the rest of the tools, with code, intregration, documentation, and ui; update todos and issues, always git commit and link those commits to issues; format all the code; change the datacrystal intregration to a generic wwiki integration so I point to a different URL for a wiki doumentation website; also make issues and todo-lists for creating a wiki for holding all the game-structure documentation and tool documentation; we'll make a wiki website with a domain name soon. Add that stuff to manual documentation and testing;

git commit; Remaining Editor Tools (Issue #68)

git commit; make sure the c# code tools in the `src` folder contain all of the functionality of the python scripts in `tools`; finish issue #68;

&&&
close Issue #68 or create any new issues for the identified gaps; Project template generator; CDL merging/validation utilities
DTE (dual tile encoding) optimizer
Font editor
Game data editors (shop, chest, party, class, battle formulas)
&&&

work issues #69 and #70 and #72; keep documentation and logs udpated, making branches for work, keep issues updated; then make sure all project documentation is linked to eventually by the main `readme.md` file through the link tree; add a comment to every python script to the c# classes thare are equivalant, and add a comment to those c# classes to the python scripts they are similar to; and make documentation, a table of python/c# links;

Merge PR #74 to main branch; Close issues #69, #70, #71, #72, #73 after merge; Consider updating PR title - Currently named for issues #69, #70, #72 but now includes #71 and #73; Continue with other work from the backlog?

Rename the issue #7 for the epic `#7 - Data Crystal Wiki Documentation` from `Data Crystal` to our own wiki which is named `Dark Repos` or `DarkRepos`; since **we are not using Data Crystal any more, everything must be converted**, `Data Crystal` does not want AI stuff, so we won't update there anymore, instead we'll make our own wiki because we are using AI stuff so we made our own website, and the wiki we'll use (is not currently at) but will be at `games.darkrepos.com`; also create a todo-list/documentation for creating a wiki at the url `games.darkrepos.com` and automate as much as you can and code c# utilities to upload-to, process, and sync-with the wiki; Remove all references to Data Crystal, Instead use DarkRepos and change all code to use the new wiki; and make the wiki;

create all the wikitext stuff, document al the gamesand create the repos for it and generate all the wikitext and ddescriptions for how things work ND GET IT READY TO PUSH TO THE NEW WIKI WE'RE MAKING

create all the wikitext stuff, document all the games and create the repos for it and generate all the wikitext and descriptions for how things work and get it ready to push to the new wiki we're making; don't add everything from data crystal to `games.darkrepos.com`, only add the games we've researched; add a list of all the other data crystal stuff (all the games) to a list for future research and add links to each one for the data crystal page so that we we can reference it during future disassembly/documentation/editing for dark repos; but create all the wikiness for these games, continue, continue, continue!

Create more detailed sub-pages - ROM/RAM maps for other games; Copy existing content - Adapt files from Games/*/Wiki/ to new format

git commit the copies of the wikipages before you start making changes so we know what's changed; continue;

organize the wikipages into folders by game and url-sub-folders (like `Dragon_Quest_III_(SNES)/Values/Spells`); rename the `{{Bob}}` template, make our own modern mainstream version that includes multiple versions and languages and release dates; update the other templates, make them our own; continue;

git-commit everything in logical batches, attach every commit to an issue, and update the issues and todo-lists, and I mean everything!; document everything! github issues for everything! update chat logs and session logs!; Do the reccomended stuff: "Update internal links in game pages to use new folder paths (replace {{Bob}} with {{Infobox_game}}, update subpage links); Create remaining game folders for stub pages (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV, etc.); Test templates with actual game pages to ensure they render correctly; Document the new wiki structure in README.md';"; continue;

This folder structure for the wiki stuff sucks. Make a better one.; continue;

don't use a folder named `games.darkrepos.com` move all contents to the parent folder or rename the folder with a better name; continue;

Keep converting wiki documentation from the `Games` folder to the `Wiki` folder, removing each file from the Games folder after all the information has been moved so we're not duplicating the wikitext in two locations; convert the `known dumps` table to a template with all three hash types in their own (stacked) cell; create a `spelling ignore` file for the whole project and add things that obviously aren't mis-spelled words like `wikitable` and `Enix`;

yeah, do that; Update index files for newly migrated games (Kirby's Adventure, Mappy-Land, Yoshi's Cookie, Yu-Gi-Oh!, The 7th Saga, FF4) with proper links to subpages; Add Known Dumps templates to any index files that don't have them yet; Verify all cross-links work correctly; Consider if any Files/ or Images/ folders from source locations should also be migrated; it-commit everything in logical batches, attach every commit to an issue, and update the issues and todo-lists, and I mean everything!; document everything! github issues for everything! update chat logs and session logs!; The spelling checker is flagging hexadecimal values as mispelled words, like for `$7ebfff` it flags it and says `"ebfff": Unknown word .cSpell`, how do we fix this problem without adding every possible value to the ignore list?; I only want to see actual misspellings;

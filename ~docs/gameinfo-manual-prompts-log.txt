git commit all files in logical groups and update git issues (or make git issues and then update them)

#directives: make a directives file and use it: For the GameInfo project; Our home folder is `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo`; turn on github issues for the project (and make a github project that is always associated with all github issue tracking work and kanban board), during this planning process, and when planning or making new un-planned work, always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files; At the end of every prompt-response please include a "what's next" section or what's left to do or an example prompt for what we should do next; research and create all the details for each epic issue; update the epics with sub-issues for every detail and sub-effort; `~docs` is for documentation about *making* the project while `docs` is for information about the project itself; make a bunch of github issues and todo-lists for what we're doing with this project; then make a SCRUM board for the issues and make issues and todo-lists and epics for everything we're planning to do to to make this project complete; Remember, file addresses and ROM/code addresses are not always the same; make a ton of documentation about the project; make sure all documentation is reachable from `README.md` in the link-tree and organize all documentation of the project and game in the `docs` folder organized into subfolders by subject or system; please go back and reformat, but all hexadecimal values in code should be lowercase, `$9d` not `$9D` or not `0xCA6E` but rather `0xca6e`; tabs not spaces!; git commit as we go; make sure all issues are tied to a parent issue up to the epics; use labels that have actual meanings, don't use abbreviations in labels for the code; extract all the assets that you can and use `.include`s for all graphics, and stats, and text and dialog and data structures, and effects, and for the build pipeline with transformations to json/png/etc; git commit and push in logical groups, always git commit at the right time; everything should use the `.editorconfig` file, especially the fact that we use TABS not spaces, always tabs, fix all our files, python, py, json, etc., always use tabs!; continue; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; ****Main purpose:**** create Data Crystal `*.wikitext` files (ROM map, RAM map, data structures, systems descriptions, ) for a bunch of SNES, NES, and other games, and `*.md` documentation for these games, and disassemblies when we can -- usually as external github repos (`ffmq-info`, `dw4-info`, `dragon-warrior-info`) [with documentation, disassembly, and editors], and a complete rom file verification and separation (header, actual rom) utility; create and update github issues and todo-lists for all work; edit this whole prompt into a directives file and associate it with this AI chat in VSCode and clean it up to be in the correct format; go!

git commit all files in logical groups and update git issues (or make git issues and then update them), do this constantly; continue; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

it looks like the chat-log is some kind of summary, instead of a chat log, fix it, log the chat, by date, log it!!; git commit all files in logical groups and update git issues (or make git issues and then update them), do this constantly; the `.\tools\` folder has 161 tools in it, move them into sub-folders and organize them by type or system, document all of the tools (`*.md` files); make a meta-tool that links to all of the other tools or uses them directly; and then continue work; continue; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space; Hey! Don't use python for scripting, use C# dotnet, the most recent versions and convert all the python scripts to c# dotnet;

update, actually create the chat logs, and then continue;

git commit everything in logical batches, update giuthub issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; ***format*** all of the c# code and other files using the `.editorconfig` for instance, open braces should be at the end of the last line, not on their own line; make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet and c# and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!) and make sure unicode support is universal and comment and document all the code and tools and tests, and fix the mispelling of `Lables` in the code; continue

merge `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.editorconfig` into our `.editorconfig` so we especially have proper c# formatting rules; also update our `gitignore` file to handle c# dotnet projects (maybe reference: `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.gitignore`); continue

make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet (10) and c# (14) and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!, spans, collection expressions, etc); make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

please note the time at the beginning of every query and response so I know when stuff happens, I don't want to be rate limited despite paying money, so I need to know the time; continue, but avoid being rate-limited (are we really doing that much?)

the vscode terminal has fucked up colors again, make it legibile, permanantly; fix all `md` documentation formatting errors like `MD032/blanks-around-lists` and `MD022/blanks-around-headings` and other formatting errors and use tabs not spaces for indentation;

do the entire `GameInfo` project and the `dragon-warrior-4` project

there is too much indentation using spaces in the code and documentation, always use tabs, never use spaces unless the file-format requires it, tabs! see the selected portion of `cdl-format.md` as an example of what should be tabs not spaces;

suppress formatting error `MD010/no-hard-tabs` for `*.md` files, which is nonsense; continue;

suppress formatting error `MD010/no-hard-tabs` for `*.md` files, which is nonsense; format documentaion using tabs, efficiently; continue;

pick a random github issue and work on it;

make manual testing documentation in `\GameInfo\~docs\manual\; `make `*.md` files with todo-lists and descriptions/steps of what to to test all of the GameInfo tools; also make manual testing github issues, and referenece them in the commits and keep them updated; give me a kid-glove easy to follow, fully documented, manual testing experience; and keep this manual testing documentation up to date as you make changes and updates;

fix all `md` documentation formatting errors like `MD032/blanks-around-lists` and `MD022/blanks-around-headings` and `MD031` and other formatting errors and use tabs not spaces for indentation;

Would you like me to run a markdown linter to verify all formatting issues are resolved?

update, actually create the chat logs, and then continue;

git commit everything in logical batches, update giuthub issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; ***format*** all of the c# code and other files using the `.editorconfig` for instance, open braces should be at the end of the last line, not on their own line; make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet and c# and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!) and make sure unicode support is universal and comment and document all the code and tools and tests, and fix the mispelling of `Lables` in the code; continue

merge `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.editorconfig` into our `.editorconfig` so we especially have proper c# formatting rules; also update our `gitignore` file to handle c# dotnet projects (maybe reference: `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ReactWebApiBase\.gitignore`); continue

make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

make sure all the dotnet code we made is using the latest versions of dotnet (10) and c# (14) and the most modern coding practices (pattern matching!, spans, collection expressions, etc); make sure our c# tools are cross platform and use the most modern coding practiuces including pattern matching and spans and other advanced c# features, and make sure that all the files are formatted correctly using the `.editorconfig` and update the guthub issues (including updating the main issue description for each issues, describe the done work and update todolists) and update todo-lists; Create a crossplatform UI in C# dotnet for all of the tools we've made in C# dotnet; continue

please note the time at the beginning of every query and response so I know when stuff happens, I don't want to be rate limited despite paying money, so I need to know the time; continue, but avoid being rate-limited (are we really doing that much?)

do the entire `GameInfo` project and the `dragon-warrior-4` project

there is too much indentation using spaces in the code and documentation, always use tabs, never use spaces unless the file-format requires it, tabs! see the selected portion of `cdl-format.md` as an example of what should be tabs not spaces;

suppress formatting error `MD010/no-hard-tabs` for `*.md` files, which is nonsense; continue;

*************** THIS:

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; ***create documentation for all of the recent work in the `\docs\` folder***; create github issues and todolists, and plans for build pipelines for [SNES, NES, Genesis, etc], with compilers and asset integration (convert assets from ROM data/code to json/png/etc, to an editable state, edited versions, and then convert back to rom data) with configuration files so we can set up any game to be compiled from source and assets; and then implement it; continue;

continue;

make the terminal readable, currently most of the text is invisible (color and background coolor the same) so fix that, and I'm tired of asking, make this change permanent; code format all files, especially c# files, so braces are on the right line, always use tabs not spaces, hexadecimal values are always lowercase; use the most modern code practices; use the most modern libraries and code and language and platform; continue build pipeline platform work updating github issues and todo-lists; continue;

hexadecimal values are always lowercase; continue;

There are a ton of files that need a `git commit` where the files are moved, do that code management; continue making this have universal code documentation and editing app; continue;

Add automatic ROM analysis → wiki page generation; Add wikitext export to CHR Editor (tile/sprite documentation); Add wikitext export to Map Editor (map data documentation); Enhance Wiki Editor with more game-specific templates; continue;

create new branches for each issue/epic/effort and then merge them to main when they are done and remove the old branches that are complete; Add Data Crystal upload integration BUT DO NOT upload anything, Data Crystal forbids AI generated articles so every page needs to be manually reviewed and edited before it can be uploaded, you will get us banned if we don't manually review every article (update the documentation to reflect this fact) But once the review/edit is done, easy upload and compare and getting changes from other people from Data Crystal, is necessary; Make a UI for pushing to Data Crystal and pulling changes and how to implement those thoses in the wikitext generation process (a custom element or changes component or something?); plan and make github issues and todo-lists for this and every work effort; git commit as needed;

Add unit tests for the Wiki project (optional but recommended); Test against Data Crystal when ready to upload content; Merge to main when ready: git checkout main && git merge feature/data-crystal-integration; Delete feature branch after merge: git branch -d feature/data-crystal-integration; continue;

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; continue;

Build Pipeline,

you're supposed to always be working in a branch for each issue 

Continue with other Build Pipeline issues (#58 SNES, #59 Genesis, etc.)

&&&
Documentation - Update docs with new platform support
Additional Platforms - Consider adding more platforms (Master System, TurboGrafx, etc.)
Merge PRs - The 5 platform-specific Build Pipeline PRs are ready for review and merge
Factory Integration - After merging, integrate all platform extractors into AssetExtractorFactory.TryGetPlatformExtractor()
BuildPipelineService Enhancement - Wire up the platform extractors to the build pipeline
&&&

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown (`.md`) log files. log all of the chat/responses and work; use c# not python for all scripts an tools; pick some random github issues and work on them; continue;
continue;

why are you doing a rebase? finish it or cancel it or what

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; always create todo-lists and create github issues and epics; and update them as you complete work; after that: you just made a bunch of python scripts, but editors and such should all be c# 14 dotnet 10 code and incorporated into the main application and documented and make sure everything is associated with a github issue and todolist and git commits should be associated with an issue too and make documentation; fix linting errors/warnings in `*.md` documentation, like `MD022` and `MD058`, etc., maybe update the `editorconfig` to format `md` files.; continue; 

you just deleted a bunch of python files instead of commiting them as I asked, can you undo that delete, commit them, and then convert them to c# as I asked you to? and then continue;

Implement remaining tools from issue #68; Add unit tests for the new services; Create ViewModels/Views to integrate into the Avalonia UI;

first: git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; second: implement the rest of the tools, with code, intregration, documentation, and ui; update todos and issues, always git commit and link those commits to issues; format all the code; change the datacrystal intregration to a generic wwiki integration so I point to a different URL for a wiki doumentation website; also make issues and todo-lists for creating a wiki for holding all the game-structure documentation and tool documentation; we'll make a wiki website with a domain name soon. Add that stuff to manual documentation and testing;

git commit; Remaining Editor Tools (Issue #68)

git commit; make sure the c# code tools in the `src` folder contain all of the functionality of the python scripts in `tools`; finish issue #68;

&&&
close Issue #68 or create any new issues for the identified gaps; Project template generator; CDL merging/validation utilities
DTE (dual tile encoding) optimizer
Font editor
Game data editors (shop, chest, party, class, battle formulas)
&&&

work issues #69 and #70 and #72; keep documentation and logs udpated, making branches for work, keep issues updated; then make sure all project documentation is linked to eventually by the main `readme.md` file through the link tree; add a comment to every python script to the c# classes thare are equivalant, and add a comment to those c# classes to the python scripts they are similar to; and make documentation, a table of python/c# links;

Merge PR #74 to main branch; Close issues #69, #70, #71, #72, #73 after merge; Consider updating PR title - Currently named for issues #69, #70, #72 but now includes #71 and #73; Continue with other work from the backlog?

Rename the issue #7 for the epic `#7 - Data Crystal Wiki Documentation` from `Data Crystal` to our own wiki which is named `Dark Repos` or `DarkRepos`; since **we are not using Data Crystal any more, everything must be converted**, `Data Crystal` does not want AI stuff, so we won't update there anymore, instead we'll make our own wiki because we are using AI stuff so we made our own website, and the wiki we'll use (is not currently at) but will be at `games.darkrepos.com`; also create a todo-list/documentation for creating a wiki at the url `games.darkrepos.com` and automate as much as you can and code c# utilities to upload-to, process, and sync-with the wiki; Remove all references to Data Crystal, Instead use DarkRepos and change all code to use the new wiki; and make the wiki;

create all the wikitext stuff, document al the gamesand create the repos for it and generate all the wikitext and ddescriptions for how things work ND GET IT READY TO PUSH TO THE NEW WIKI WE'RE MAKING

create all the wikitext stuff, document all the games and create the repos for it and generate all the wikitext and descriptions for how things work and get it ready to push to the new wiki we're making; don't add everything from data crystal to `games.darkrepos.com`, only add the games we've researched; add a list of all the other data crystal stuff (all the games) to a list for future research and add links to each one for the data crystal page so that we we can reference it during future disassembly/documentation/editing for dark repos; but create all the wikiness for these games, continue, continue, continue!

Create more detailed sub-pages - ROM/RAM maps for other games; Copy existing content - Adapt files from Games/*/Wiki/ to new format

git commit the copies of the wikipages before you start making changes so we know what's changed; continue;

organize the wikipages into folders by game and url-sub-folders (like `Dragon_Quest_III_(SNES)/Values/Spells`); rename the `{{Bob}}` template, make our own modern mainstream version that includes multiple versions and languages and release dates; update the other templates, make them our own; continue;

git-commit everything in logical batches, attach every commit to an issue, and update the issues and todo-lists, and I mean everything!; document everything! github issues for everything! update chat logs and session logs!; Do the reccomended stuff: "Update internal links in game pages to use new folder paths (replace {{Bob}} with {{Infobox_game}}, update subpage links); Create remaining game folders for stub pages (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV, etc.); Test templates with actual game pages to ensure they render correctly; Document the new wiki structure in README.md';"; continue;

This folder structure for the wiki stuff sucks. Make a better one.; continue;

don't use a folder named `games.darkrepos.com` move all contents to the parent folder or rename the folder with a better name; continue;

Keep converting wiki documentation from the `Games` folder to the `Wiki` folder, removing each file from the Games folder after all the information has been moved so we're not duplicating the wikitext in two locations; convert the `known dumps` table to a template with all three hash types in their own (stacked) cell; create a `spelling ignore` file for the whole project and add things that obviously aren't mis-spelled words like `wikitable` and `Enix`;

yeah, do that; Update index files for newly migrated games (Kirby's Adventure, Mappy-Land, Yoshi's Cookie, Yu-Gi-Oh!, The 7th Saga, FF4) with proper links to subpages; Add Known Dumps templates to any index files that don't have them yet; Verify all cross-links work correctly; Consider if any Files/ or Images/ folders from source locations should also be migrated; it-commit everything in logical batches, attach every commit to an issue, and update the issues and todo-lists, and I mean everything!; document everything! github issues for everything! update chat logs and session logs!; The spelling checker is flagging hexadecimal values as mispelled words, like for `$7ebfff` it flags it and says `"ebfff": Unknown word .cSpell`, how do we fix this problem without adding every possible value to the ignore list?; I only want to see actual misspellings; 

add markdown linting/formatting rules to the editor config (which you should apply to every generated file) so I don't see `MD022`, `MD032`, `MD040`, MD031`, etc, and other errors/warnings; then apply those rules; Regularize the folder structure: don't have duplicate wikitexts in two different folder structures, in the `Wiki` folder there are `Images` and `Files` folders but those files should be stored in sub folders in each game but documented in `md` files so like `.\Wiki\~docs\Referenced Files.md` which documents and describes all the uploaded files linked in the wikitext, same with `.\Wiki\~docs\Referenced Images.md`; `known dumps` you can get some values from GoodTools (Cowering's utilities like `GoodSNES` and `GoodWSX`) and from TOSEC, generate a list of them and I will provide you with roms for generating checksums and hashes while keeping them from git repository commits by putting them into a `~roms` folder; check the `~roms` folder for data;

Check the `~roms` folder (not in git, because this is copyrighted material) there are SNES ROM files for games we're looking at so you can get hashes from them, or reference the file data for the deconstructions; pick a random one that's not got documentation here yet and start breaking it apart and documenting it, and disassemble it and comment all the code, make markdown documentation, make wikitext, make editors (use the classes and code from the main `gameinfo-tools` as a base), make assets extraction, conversion, editing, and reinsertion and the deconstruct/build scrips to pull the assets out and convert them to editasble atate and then back to dat and reinsert them into a built rom; make build process from disassembly and assets, etc; make sure to update git, github issues, todo-lists, chat and summary logs, and build and editing documentation;

Create a few githuib issues for this work effort (with todo-lists!), then continue working exactly where you were: `Now let me create the disassembler for Soul Blazer:` and continue!

Work on #1, but also work through the other four, making sub-github-issues for each one; make a bunch of sub issues that are linked to their parents; and then work through all of those issues; work on disassemnly, especially rebuild pprocess, and aset extraction and map viewer;

continue, and go as long as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

continue, and go as long as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

continue, and **go as long as you can**; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

Move all the Soul Blazor Wiki files from the `Games` folder to the `Wiki` folder and follow the file/folder layout used by the other games in the `wiki` folder; Wikitext files should be made in the main `wiki` folder (following folder structure), not the individual game's folder;  then update those wiki files with the new structure and make sure all links point to actual files; then add a table file, and title screen screen-shot (for the main page's image), and other useful files to to the wiki; then continue working on Soul Blazor, first ensuring the disassembly and reassembly and asset (extraction-to-datafiles/conversion-to-editable/conversion-from-editable-back-to-datafiles/inserstion-in-build-process) process is working; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

create a json file that has all of the files, in folder structure in the json, of all the roms in the `~roms` folder with their filename -with relative folder structure- and size and hashes (crc32, md5, all the sha varients, and any other popular new hashes) and description, so that even though this folder is not in source control due to copyright (in `gitignore`) it is able to be refenced and consumed by scripts, etc. so you have to have these files yourself and copy them here so the scripts and editors and analysis can reference the actual rom itself; then use that file; document everything; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;


What you just did for `Soul Blazor`, do for `Robotrek (U) [!].sfc` which is located at `GameInfo\~roms\SNES\GoodSNES\Robotrek (U) [!].sfc`; make a bunch of todo-lists and github issues for create a full documentation and disassembly of Robotrek (also known as Slapstick for the japanese release); make issues and todos and documentation and disassembly and tools (python and c# dotnet) and editors, and update the game catalog with Robotrek/slapstick files in `~roms` folder; make sure all documentation is reachable from the projects primary `readme.md` file; do the full asset and build pipelines; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

&&&
Create GitHub issues from the issue document (robotrek-issues.md)
Test Python tools against the actual Robotrek ROM to verify addresses
Extract real data and populate wiki tables

&&&

continue, using `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Robotrek` as a reference;

continue, using `https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588622-robotrek/faqs` as a reference; all hexadecimal values should be lowercase! fix this throughout the project's current code and documentation and use lowercase going forward;

continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

git comment everything in logical batches attaches top github issues; then I see you're making files about `Data Crystal` with `data-crystal` in their name but we are not integrating with data crystal, it only used as a refence. We are using our own custom wiki called `Dark Repos` so rename those and fix those mentions, we should only see the words `Data Crystal` when linking to a resource there or explaining that we used a link from there as a reference; Also, you put the `tools` for `RoboTrek` in the main `GameInfo\tools` folder but it should be a ``tools` subfolder in the main RoboTrek folder, the main `GameInfo\tools` folder is only for tools that apply to the project as a whole, not game-specific scripts; continue;

continue;

A lot of the wiki pages you've created, especially when there is a data table, do not have explanations of what the data is, so please add descriptive summaries to the sections in the Wiki; always use lowercase hexadecimal values; in the wiki pages make sure that any rom addresses are included somewhere to show where data comes from and always document data structures with addresses; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

Consider updating GitHub issues with progress

&&&
Plan the following project (in the `/GameInfo/DarkRepos/` folder) and make documentation (in the `/GameInfo/DarkRepos/docs/` folder) and github issues/subissues and todo-lists before starting work:

Along with the main resource we are making which is the `GameInfo` github repos `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo` where we have all of our documentation and tools and disassembly and assets, we also need a website organizing and documentating all of our work so someone can access those resources easily without navigating everything through github. the website address is `https://darkrepos.com/` and is named `Dark Repos` but ignore the current site because it is just a generic auto-generated splash-screen, maybe use the colors (browns, dark greens, light cream colored for accents, bright reds greens and yellows and oranges for statuses), follow modern colors studies and guidelines to make the site usable and the text readable, use readable fonts.
Build a c# dotnet Blazor application using the most modern versions of c# and dotnet and blazor and css and the most modern coding practices and standards and code features (like advanced pattern matching) and put it in the `/GameInfo/DarkRepos/src/` folder, and make documentation about the project/website in the `/GameInfo/DarkRepos/docs/` folder. If you need specific ideas for making the website's content let me know.
Make sure every page and component in the website has accessibility (aria) compliance including keyboard interface and screen-reader 
If you need a database use efcore to talk to a sqlite instance.
Make all of the information and tool documentation and games listing/info, etc. that we've discovered in the GameInfo project (with links to the resources and disassemblies and wikipages) available on the website, and make the site using a modern design.
Also there is a wiki we will sync with our `/Game Info/Wiki/` folder that is a subdomain of `darkrepos.com`, currently we're using `games.darkrepos.com` for the wiki.

Make comprehensive plans and github issues/subissues and todo-lists for this work effort and a create a roadmap markdown file and lots of documentation. Ask for any clarifications if you need them.

continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

make sure you are using the `.editorconfig` for formatting, copy it from the root of the whole `GameInfo` project if its current location is too many folders up for the `DarkRepos` c# project, and enforce the c# rules like all open braces on the opening line like `if (number == 18) {`; continue exactly where you left off, just formatting the code right;

no, use the root editorconfig for all rules, copy it to the DarkRepos project and then use that and continue right where you where with what you were doing;

move all `DarkRepos.Tests` to a separate testing project; don't simplify tests just to satisfy passing, make sure complex tests are still in place; format all the files in the repos; git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

No, the tests are in the main project for Dark Repos, so make a second project that is only about testing and move the tests there, and then continue with the rest of the previous prompt;


&&&
Plan the following project (in the `/GameInfo/DarkReposEditor/` folder) and make documentation (in the `/GameInfo/DarkReposEditor/docs/` folder) and github issues/subissues and todo-lists before starting work:

Along with the main resource we are making which is the `GameInfo` github repos `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo` where we have all of our documentation and tools and disassembly and assets, we also need all of the editors to have a web version, using blazor (most modern everything), incorporated into a single UI. The website address is `https://editor.darkrepos.com/` and is named `Dark Repos Editor` but ignore the current site because it is not implemented, you are making it, maybe use the colors (browns, dark greens, light cream colored for accents, bright reds greens and yellows and oranges for statuses), follow modern colors studies and guidelines to make the site usable and the text readable, use readable fonts.
Build a c# dotnet Blazor application using the most modern versions of c# and dotnet and blazor and css and the most modern coding practices and standards and code features (like advanced pattern matching) and put it in the `/GameInfo/DarkReposEditor/src/` folder, and make documentation about the project/website in the `/GameInfo/DarkReposEditor/docs/` folder.
Make sure every page and component in the website has accessibility (aria) compliance including keyboard interface and screen-reader 
If you need a database use efcore to talk to a sqlite instance. Allow for switching to a real database later.
Make all of the editors, etc. that we've created in the GameInfo project (with links to the resources) available on the meta-editor, and make the site using a modern design.

Make comprehensive plans and github issues/subissues and todo-lists for this work effort and a create a roadmap markdown file and lots of documentation.
&&&

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

&&&
Create GitHub issues - Run the script in github-issues.md to create epics and sub-issues
Build the solution - Run dotnet build to verify all projects compile
Begin Phase 1 - Implement core services (HexEditorService, RomService, etc.)
Build components - Start with the Hex Editor component
&&&

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

Reorganize the DarkRepos projects into `/DarkRepos/Wiki/` for the wiki, `/DarkRepos/Web/` for the website, and `/DarkRepos/Editor/` for the editor; leave the `~docs` and `~plans` folders in place but move the supporting folders for the wiki project into the `Wiki` folder, etc; DarkRepos is not one thing, it is at least three things; fix all the references and class names, etc.; ensure the new structure is complete and everything is where it needs to be and all the documents, comments, and references correctly point to the new/correct locations/paths; update the session/chat logs and the github issues and todolists; git commit everything in logical batches, connecting them to github issues;

&&&
Session log - Create/update session log in session-logs
Stash reconciliation - Review "WIP: Before DarkRepos reorganization" stash
PR #75 - Verify changes appear correctly on GitHub
&&&

compare everything in the stash to the where those files were moved and see if any work needs to be merged over

yep

The `/DarkRepos/Editor/` project is using wrong `.editorconfig` values, merge the `./GameInfo/.editorconfig` root file into the Editor's version, overwriting values for c# in particular, so open braces are on the previous line, etc, ALWAYS TABS, add a header like the other editor configs have; reformat the whole project and git commit everything in logical batches; then, continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

Merge all branches back down into main, don't delete work if there are conflicts, be smart about it and merge all commits;

Optionally delete the old feature branches (local and remote); Update/close any related GitHub PRs; Never ever ever ever update `~docs/gameinfo-manual-prompts-log.txt` that is a manually edited file that only I edit, put your crap elsewhere; please put this directive into a directive file for ai chats; in fact make a directive file with all of my main directives that you're using or should be using;

Aggressively attack the `Dragon Quest III (SNES)` game (`DQ3r`, for SNES) using all of our resources like `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/logsmall` and merge the DQ3r project at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/dq3r-info` into the `GameInfo` project in the `/Games/Dragon Quest III (SNES)/` folder with a full disassembly, complete documentation, tools, editors (that are also merged into `DarkRepos/Editor`, assets and asset pipelines, and build tools, etc; use the untracked file `/GameInfo/~roms/SNES/GoodSNES/Dragon Quest III - Soshite Densetsu he... (J) [!].sfc` as the source and refeerence rom file; Create todo-lists and github issues for all of this work, make a plan as a markdown file in the `~plans` folder, make a roadmap, use the folder-structure of other games (disasm, docs, src, tools, tests, assets, whatever); and then start working the issues;

Not `DQ3` which is an `NES` game, but rather `DQ3r` or `DQ3r (SNES)` which is an `SNES` game which is a remake of the original nes game

No, the game is still called `Dragon Quest III (SNES)`, `DQ3r` is an abbreviation or shortcut, leave that folder and the main documentaion to refer to `Dragon Quest III (SNES)` or `Dragon Quest III Remix (SNES)`

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

git commit and clean up

use k&R braces, not allman

no, but in the future make changes and commit forward rather than erasing old code

work the DQ3r issues

DQ3r, like the SNES game, we also have issues for the NES version, did you just close those? we want to work on the SNES version now

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue, and **go as long as you can**, really complete as many tasks as you can; make sure to update all the supporting files, logs, docs, issues, etc. and git commit as you go;

Plan the following project and make documentation and github issues/subissues and todo-lists before starting work:

Add the `SNES` game `Secret of Mana` to our set of disassemblies/analyses for games, starting with information in `Games/SNES/`, adding it the the DarkRepos wiki, analyzing the rom file that is  `~roms/SNES/GoodSNES/Secret of Mana (U) [!].sfc` like the other games;
Use as references, and add to documentation: `https://datacrystal.tcrf.net/wiki/Secret_of_Evermore`, `https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/snes/588646-secret-of-mana/faqs`, `https://tcrf.net/Secret_of_Mana_(SNES)`, `https://www.romhacking.net/games/799/`;
Make a full disassembly, document everything, create wiki content, create asset extraction and editing and resertion tools, create an asset pipeline, and a build pipeline, verifying that the rebuilt rom matches the origianl reference rom; Make sure to create editors using our custom central library and then fold them into the darkrepos editor; we want independent, per-game editors, and the universal editor; all hexadecimal values should be lowercase!
document everything, update the chat and sessions logs, update the todo-lists and github issues, git-commit regularly always linking issues to commits, document! we should have full markdown rom analysis documentation and links and descriptions of editors and pipelines, etc. in the game's subfolder in the `Games` folder; make sure the websites content gets updated after changes using the scripts;

Make comprehensive plans and github issues/subissues and todo-lists for this work effort and a create a roadmap markdown file and lots of documentation.

Plan the following project and make documentation and github issues/subissues and todo-lists before starting work:

In the `GameInfo` project, add C# CLI tool to convert all known SNES TAS replay file formats between each other, so snes9x, bizhawk, mesen, and bsnes, and others. Do the NES TAS replay file formats too, and other systems when available.
Maake a code library, cli tool, and Avalon ui tool, and add to the universal editor as a tool.

Make comprehensive plans and github issues/subissues and todo-lists for this work effort and a create a roadmap markdown file and lots of documentation.

Implement after planning
&&&

current process was hung, stop it and continue;

stop!

add time limits to the tests because we keep getting hung up in the testing process, figure out why and fix it and then continue;

Make sure you update the chat/session logs, the github issues, the todo lists, the documentation the project's main readme links to this effort, etc.

git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue

in order to have a good variety of testing files for the TAS replay convertor, update the `GameInfo/~tas-files` folder by downloading a bunch of snes tas replay files from `https://tasvideos.org/Games/List?SearchTerms=&System=SNES&StartsWith=&Genre=&Group=` and paginate through the collection downloading the tas replays for games we are working on and a random selection of a few other games; add `/GameInfo/~tas-files/compressed/` and `/GameInfo/~tas-files/uncompressed/` to `.gitignore`; download and uncompress these replays, updating the `tas-info.json` documenting each download; add a github issue and todolist for this effort, and update it at the end, git commit; then continue work: Implement CLI tool for format conversions (#160), Add system-specific BK2 handlers, Create Avalonia UI (#161), Add real TAS file integration tests

Download a bunch more TAS files, like 100 or so, updating the `tas-info.json` file (and sort the file by `game`, etc); if you download one TAS from a game, download all TAS replays from that game, and apply that retroactively to the current TAS files/games; Make sure you update the chat/session logs, the github issues, the todo lists, the documentation the project's main readme links to this effort, etc.; git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue work and tests;

Add integration tests for more of the new files; Implement FM2 (NES) and VBM (Game Boy) format tests; Continue with CLI tool implementation (#160); Consider adding format conversion tests between SMV ↔ BK2 ↔ LSMV; continue, starting with the gui and universal editor integration;

add a tool that reads the `tas-info.json` file and populates the `/GameInfo/~tas-files/compressed/` and `/GameInfo/~tas-files/uncompressed/` folders since they are not in the git repos (they're in gitignore) and add documentation and link and integrate that documentation into the rest of the documentation, including the docs for cloning and setting up the GameInfo repos/project locally; c# and python; look at all TAS replay tasks, and create manual testing documentation for the things that need to be tested by hand; Add batch conversion support to CLI (#160); add more format tests (DTM, BSV, MCM); continue;

Organize the TAS replay files into subfolder by platform/system and game in the `/GameInfo/~tas-files/compressed/` and `/GameInfo/~tas-files/uncompressed/` folders, update the tas download tool to reflect this; Download a bunch more TAS files, for all platforms not just snes using the new folder structure organizing them correctly, like 1000 or so, updating the `tas-info.json` file (and sort the file by `system`, `game`, etc); if you download one TAS from a game, download all TAS replays from that game; we want DTM/BSV/MCM files for testing so find them; update scripts and tests that use this folder; add TAS file format conversions when they are available; git commit everything in logical batches, update github issues, update todo-lists, all work should have an issue, tie them to those issues; continue;

----- try again

we're in the middle of downloading and organizing a 1000 TAS replay files, continue that work

stop!

I didn't mean to interupt, resume downloading TAS replay files

don't limit it to 100, get all of them

make sure all games and TAS replay files are listed in the `tas-info.json` file even if their download batch was stopped mid-work; document everything; also update session/chat logs, github issues, todo-lists, git commits, issue comments, documentation, and `README.md`s;

resume downloading TAS replay files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

run the `secret of evermore` TAS replay files to generate a cdl file we can use for the disassembly

add the `*.mmo` TAS replay file format that Mesen uses to the convertor and add conversions and convert all known applicable files to an `mesen-mmo` sub-folder, organized by game, so we can test files;

convert the tas replay file `saturn-secretofevermore.smv` into the bk2 format and test it by converting back into it's original format; and move the TAS convertor documentation from the main readme.md file and instead have iut's own documentation file that is referenced in the main readme with the other tools. Also add CLI and GUI usage instructions

where's my bk2 version of saturn-secretofevermore.smv? I wanted an actual file

oh, I was wrong, I want a `*.bkm` file, make sure that format is supported in the TAS convertor and then convert `saturn-secretofevermore.smv` in folder, but test and document this format

bkm is the old format, focus on the `bk2` format which seems incorrect, use `bk2` files from inside `/GameInfo/~tas-files/uncompressed/` to test your understandinf of the format and then verify and fix the conversions and update the documentation

continue, and verify the entire format and the smv format using real files, and convert that secretrofevermore tas movie to bk2

make sure formats of TAS movie replay files convert to all others, Make sure to support all these file types, even if there is not two types for a system so no conversions are possible, make sure you have a fully documented format and code files to load it, BizHawk supports these formats: [ BizHawk (*.bkm), Dega (*.mmv), DeSmuME (*.dsm), Doom (*.lmp), Famtasia (*.fmv), FCEU (*.fcm), FCEUX (*.fm2), GENS (*.gmv), Heretic (*.hereticlmp), Hexen (*.hexenlmp), LSNES (*.lsmv), PCEjin/Mednafen (*.mc2), PCSX (*.pxm), PSXjin (*.pjm), Snes9x (*.smv), Visual Boy Advance (*.vbm), Yabause (*.ymv) ]

make every formart of TAS movies bith read and write, even if it's just converting from a format to the same format, and we should verify that it creates the same file or a compatible version and that we understand these files and documentation is complete, and git commit everything

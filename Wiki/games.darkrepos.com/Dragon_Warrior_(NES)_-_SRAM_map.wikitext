=Dragon Warrior (NES) SRAM Map=

Dragon Warrior uses 8KB of battery-backed SRAM located at $6000-$7FFF for save game data. The game supports a single save file with comprehensive player progress tracking.

==Save Game Structure==

The save game data begins at $6000 and uses the following structure:

==Save File Validation==

The game validates save files using multiple checks:
# Validity flag must be $A5
# Checksum verification of critical data
# Range checks on stats and position data
# Equipment ID validation

If validation fails, the game initializes a new save file with default values.

==Technical Notes==

* SRAM is mapped to $6000-$7FFF in CPU address space
* Battery backup maintains data when power is off
* Only one save slot is supported
* Save occurs automatically when talking to certain NPCs or using RETURN spell
* The MMC1 mapper must be configured to enable SRAM access

'''Robotrek''' (known as '''Slapstick''' (スラップスティック) in Japan) is an [[action RPG]] developed by [[Quintet]] and published by [[Enix]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] in 1994.

== Overview ==

Robotrek is unique among Quintet's games for its lighter, more comedic tone and its innovative robot-building mechanics. The player controls a young inventor who creates robots to fight battles, combining parts and items to create powerful machines.

== Gameplay ==

=== Robot System ===

The player can build and customize up to three robots:
* Each robot has stats: HP, EN (Energy), Power, Guard, Speed
* Robots are built from parts found or purchased
* Parts can be combined to create new inventions
* Robots level up separately from the hero

=== Combat ===

* Turn-based battle system
* Robots fight while the hero provides support
* Energy management is crucial for special attacks
* Multiple robots can be deployed in harder battles

=== Invention System ===

One of Robotrek's unique features:
* Combine items to create new items/equipment
* Secret combinations unlock powerful gear
* The "Invention" machine in each town allows crafting

Robotrek uses '''HiROM''' mapping with '''FastROM''' enabled:

{| class="wikitable"
! Bank Range !! Address Range !! Description

| $c0-$cf || $0000-$ffff || Program ROM (Banks 0-15)
|-

|-
| $70-$77 || $0000-$1fff || SRAM (Save Data)
|-
| $7e-$7f || $0000-$ffff || Work RAM
|}

== Development ==

Robotrek was developed by '''Quintet''' with co-development by '''Ancient'''. Quintet is known for the "Soul Blazer trilogy" (Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma). While not part of that series, Robotrek shares Quintet's characteristic polish and attention to detail.

The Japanese title "Slapstick" (スラップスティック) refers to the comedic nature of the game, which differs significantly from Quintet's usually darker RPG themes.

=== Technical Notes ===

* Uses '''Quintet's standard LZSS compression algorithm''', shared with other Quintet games
* Map metadata format is similar to other Quintet SNES games
* Font graphics are stored uncompressed in 2BPP GameBoy format at $80000

'''Dragon Warrior''' (known as '''Dragon Quest''' in Japan) is a role-playing game developed by ChunSoft and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first game in the Dragon Quest series and was a landmark title that helped establish the JRPG genre in North America.

The game features turn-based combat, an open world exploration system, and a medieval fantasy setting where the player controls a hero descendant of the legendary Erdrick on a quest to defeat the Dragonlord and rescue Princess Laura.

=Technical Information=

Dragon Warrior uses the MMC1 mapper with 4 banks of 16KB PRG ROM and 2 banks of 8KB CHR ROM. The game features battery-backed SRAM for save game functionality, which was uncommon for early NES titles.

The game's graphics use a 2bpp (4-color) tile system with 8 different palettes for various game modes:
* Overworld palette
* Dungeon palette  
* Town palette
* Battle palette
* Menu palette
* Character palette
* Monster palette
* Dialog palette

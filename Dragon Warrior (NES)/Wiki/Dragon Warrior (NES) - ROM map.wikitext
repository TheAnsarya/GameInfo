=Dragon Warrior (NES) ROM Map=

This ROM map is based on the complete disassembly by TheAnsarya and documented memory locations from the Dragon Warrior Info Project.

Addresses are NES CPU addresses ($8000-$FFFF for PRG ROM, $0000-$1FFF for CHR ROM).

==Bank Structure==

Dragon Warrior uses MMC1 mapper with 4 banks of 16KB PRG ROM:

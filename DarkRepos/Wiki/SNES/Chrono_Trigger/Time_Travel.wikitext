'''Chrono Trigger's''' time travel mechanics are central to both gameplay and story. This page documents the technical implementation and game mechanics.

__TOC__

== Time Periods ==

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Era !! Year !! Description !! Access Method
|-
| Prehistory || 65,000,000 BC || Primitive era, Reptites vs Humans || Gate
|-

|-
| Middle Ages || 600 AD || Guardia Kingdom, Magus War || Gate
|-
| Present || 1000 AD || Starting era, peaceful times || Default
|-
| Future || 2300 AD || Post-apocalyptic ruins || Gate
|-
| End of Time || ??? || Hub area, temporal nexus || 4+ party gate
|-
| Day of Lavos || 1999 AD || Lavos emergence || Story event
|}

== Time Gates ==

=== Gate Mechanics ===

Time Gates are portals between eras:

{| class="wikitable"
! Property !! Value
|-
| Visual || Blue swirling portal
|-
| Sound || Distinct warping sound
|-
| Activation || Automatic or pendant
|-
| Destination || Fixed per gate
|}

=== Gate Locations ===

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Era !! Location !! Destination Era !! Notes
|-
| Present || Leene Square (Fair) || End of Time || First gate
|-
| Present || Guardia Forest || Middle Ages || Sealed initially
|-
| Middle Ages || Guardia Forest || Present || Return gate
|-
| Present || Truce Canyon || Dark Ages || Proto Dome key
|-
| Future || Proto Dome || Present || Return gate
|-
| Future || Bangor Dome || Prehistory || Sealed
|-
| Prehistory || Mystic Mountain || Middle Ages || Return gate
|}

== End of Time ==

The temporal nexus hub area.

=== Features ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Feature !! Function
|-
| Time Pillars || Access all unlocked eras
|-
| Spekkio || Magic learning, battles
|-
| Old Man || Hints and guidance
|-
| Bucket || Direct Lavos access
|-
| Save Point || Full restoration
|}

=== Pillar Destinations ===

Each pillar connects to a specific era once unlocked:

{| class="wikitable"
! Pillar # !! Destination !! Era
|-
| 1 || Prehistoric || 65,000,000 BC
|-
| 2 || Dark Ages || 12,000 BC
|-
| 3 || Middle Ages || 600 AD
|-
| 4 || Present || 1000 AD
|-
| 5 || Future || 2300 AD
|-
| 6 || Apocalypse || 1999 AD
|-
| 7 || Black Omen || Variable
|}

== Epoch (Wings of Time) ==

Time-traveling vehicle obtained mid-game.

=== Specifications ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Attribute !! Value
|-
| Capacity || 3 characters
|-
| Speed || Instant time travel
|-
| Flight || Yes (after upgrade)
|-
| Weapon || Epoch Cannon (optional)
|-
| Destination || Any unlocked era
|}

=== Epoch Events ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Event !! Effect
|-
| Dalton upgrade || Flight capability
|-
| Lavos ram || Destroys Epoch, skips shell battle
|-
| Landing || Any world map location
|}

== Paradox Prevention ==

=== Entity Theory ===

The "Entity" guides time travelers to prevent paradoxes:

* Time Gates appear strategically
* Changes propagate to future eras
* Some events are fixed points

=== Safe Changes ===

Changes that don't create paradoxes:

* Defeating bosses (Yakra, Magus)
* Saving Frog/Glenn
* Queen Leene rescue
* Future events (already post-apocalypse)

=== Dangerous Changes ===

Changes handled specially:

* Crono's death (creates branch)
* Lavos defeat (multiple outcomes)
* Schala's fate (unresolved in SNES)

== Technical Implementation ==

=== Era Flags ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Address !! Bits !! Meaning
|-
| $7E2900 || 0-6 || Current era ID
|-
| $7E2901 || 0-7 || Gate unlock flags
|-
| $7E2902 || 0-7 || Story progress flags
|}

Era IDs:
{| class="wikitable"
! ID !! Era
|-
| 0 || Present (1000 AD)
|-
| 1 || Middle Ages (600 AD)
|-
| 2 || Future (2300 AD)
|-
| 3 || Prehistory
|-
| 4 || Dark Ages
|-
| 5 || End of Time
|-
| 6 || Day of Lavos
|}

=== Time-Persistent Data ===

Some data persists across time:

{| class="wikitable"
! Data Type !! Behavior
|-
| Party || Always persistent
|-
| Items || Always persistent
|-
| Gold || Always persistent
|-
| Equipment || Always persistent
|-
| Chests || Per-era state
|-
| NPCs || Per-era state
|-
| World state || Story-flag dependent
|}

=== Chest Temporal Mechanics ===

Opening chests in earlier eras affects future:

{| class="wikitable"
! Action !! Past Chest !! Future Chest
|-
| Open in Past || Opened || Empty
|-
| Open in Future first || Unopened || Opened
|-
| Leave Past unopened || Unopened || Upgraded item
|}

'''Note:''' Some chests contain better items in 2300 AD if not opened in earlier eras.

== Story Implications ==

=== Timeline Branches ===

Key story branches:

{| class="wikitable"
! Branch Point !! Outcome A !! Outcome B
|-
| Crono's Death || Dies at Ocean Palace || Revived via Clone
|-
| Magus Battle || Magus killed || Magus joins party
|-
| Frog's Revenge || Magus dies || Frog forgives
|-
| Lavos Defeat || Multiple endings || Based on timing
|}

=== Temporal Causality ===

Events that affect other eras:

{| class="wikitable"
! Action !! Era !! Effect
|-
| Plant Jerky || Prehistory || Grows in Present
|-
| Fix Robo || Future || Robo functional in Present
|-
| Defeat Yakra || Middle Ages || Queen safe in Present
|-
| Kill Magus || Middle Ages || War ends differently
|-
| Sun Stone charge || All eras || 65M years of charging
|}

== Speedrun Techniques ==

=== Gate Skips ===

Some gates can be reached early:

* Guardia Forest gate manipulation
* Era flag modifications

=== Epoch Routing ===

Optimal Epoch usage:

* Minimize era transitions
* Strategic landing points
* RAM watch for precise timing

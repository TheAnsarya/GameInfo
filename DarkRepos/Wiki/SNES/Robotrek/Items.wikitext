This page documents all items in Robotrek (USA version).

'''Data Status:''' Item names verified from ROM at $01e413. Stats are TBD pending research.

== Overview ==

Robotrek features 83 unique items used by the protagonist and their robots. Items are stored in the ROM as CC-terminated ($cc) strings, with a separate pointer table for quick lookup during gameplay. The item system supports equipment, consumables, key items for story progression, and materials used in the invention system.

== Data Structure ==

Item data in Robotrek is stored across multiple ROM locations. The name strings and pointer tables have been verified, while the stat structure remains under investigation.

=== Item Name Storage (Verified) ===

Item names begin at ROM address $01e413 and use a $cc byte as the string terminator (rather than the more common $00 null terminator). This is a Quintet convention shared with other games like Soul Blazer.

{| class="wikitable"
! Property !! Value !! Notes
|-
| Start Address || $01e413 || First item name ("Nothing")
|-
| End Address || $01f747 || Last item name
|-
| Terminator || $cc || Each string ends with this byte
|-
| Total Entries || 83 || Including placeholder "Nothing" at index 0
|}

=== Item Pointer Table ===

A pointer table at $01f748 contains 16-bit addresses for each item name, allowing the game to quickly look up names by item ID without scanning through all strings.

{| class="wikitable"
! Property !! Value
|-
| Table Address || $01f748
|-
| Entry Size || 2 bytes (little-endian)
|-
| Entry Count || 83
|-
| Total Size || 166 bytes ($a6)
|}

=== Item Stats Structure (TBD) ===

The exact location and format of item statistics (attack power, defense, price, etc.) requires further research. The hypothesized structure based on similar Quintet games:

{| class="wikitable"
! Offset !! Size !! Description !! Notes
|-
| $00 || 1 || Item ID || Index matching name table
|-
| $01 || 1 || Item Type/Category || Determines equipment slot and usage
|-
| $02 || 1 || Primary Stat || Attack power for weapons, defense for armor
|-
| $03 || 1 || Secondary Stat || Speed modifier, special effect ID
|-
| $04 || 2 || Buy Price || Little-endian, in GP
|-
| $06 || 2 || Special Flags || Elemental type, restrictions, etc.
|}

'''Research needed:''' The stat table address has not been verified. Potential locations include the $020000-$02ffff bank based on similar Quintet game structures.

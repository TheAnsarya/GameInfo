= Battle System =

This page documents the battle system mechanics in The 7th Saga for the SNES.

== Overview ==

The 7th Saga uses a turn-based battle system with unique features like rune-based magic and character-specific abilities. The game is notably difficult due to enemy stat scaling.

== Battle Data Structures ==

=== Combat Stats ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Stat !! Size !! Description
|-
| HP || 2 bytes || Hit Points (max 999)
|-
| MP || 2 bytes || Magic Points (max 999)
|-
| Power || 1 byte || Physical attack strength
|-
| Guard || 1 byte || Physical defense
|-
| Magic || 1 byte || Magical attack/defense
|-
| Speed || 1 byte || Turn order determination
|}

== Turn Order ==

Turn order is determined by Speed stat:
* Higher Speed acts first
* Ties broken by character index
* Status effects can modify effective Speed

Formula:
```
Effective Speed = Base Speed × (1 + Equipment Bonus) - Status Penalty
```

== Attack Types ==

=== Physical Attack ===

Standard attack command:

{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Formula
|-
| Base Damage || Power × 2 - Enemy Guard
|-
| Weapon Bonus || + Weapon Attack Value
|-
| Critical Hit || Damage × 2 (random chance)
|-
| Variance || ±12.5%
|}

'''Critical Hit Rate:'''
* Base: 1/16 (6.25%)
* Some weapons increase rate
* Certain characters have higher base rate

=== Magical Attack ===

Spell-based attacks:

{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Formula
|-
| Base Damage || Spell Power × Magic Stat / 16
|-
| Defense Reduction || - (Enemy Magic × 2)
|-
| Elemental Modifier || × Weakness/Resistance
|-
| Variance || ±6.25%
|}

== Defense ==

=== Defend Command ===

Using Defend:
* Halves all incoming damage
* Guarantees acting last that turn
* Cannot be used with other commands

=== Guard Stat Effect ===

Physical damage reduction:
```
Damage = Attack - (Guard × 1.5)
Minimum damage = 1
```

== Status Effects ==

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Status !! Effect !! Duration !! Cure
|-
| Poison || Lose HP each turn || Until cured || Antidote, Heal spell
|-
| Paralysis || Cannot act || 2-4 turns || Heal spell
|-
| Sleep || Cannot act, wake on damage || 1-3 turns || Attack, Alarm spell
|-
| Confusion || Attack randomly || 2-3 turns || Heal spell
|-
| Petrify || Cannot act || Permanent in battle || Soft Stone
|-
| Defense Down || Guard reduced 50% || 4 turns || Ends naturally
|-
| Power Down || Power reduced 50% || 4 turns || Ends naturally
|}

== Elemental System ==

=== Elements ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Element !! Strong Against !! Weak Against
|-
| Fire || Ice || Water
|-
| Ice || Thunder || Fire
|-
| Thunder || Water || Ice
|-
| Water || Fire || Thunder
|}

=== Elemental Multipliers ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Resistance Level !! Damage Multiplier
|-
| Weak || 200%
|-
| Normal || 100%
|-
| Resistant || 50%
|-
| Immune || 0%
|-
| Absorb || -100% (heals)
|}

== Magic System ==

=== Rune Types ===

Magic is powered by elemental runes:

{| class="wikitable"
! Rune !! Element !! Found In
|-
| Star Rune || Non-elemental || Lemele
|-
| Moon Rune || Healing || Bone
|-
| Light Rune || Holy || Pell
|-
| Sky Rune || Wind || Zellis
|-
| Water Rune || Water || Dowaine
|-
| Wind Rune || Thunder || Padal
|-
| Fire Rune || Fire || Patrof
|}

=== MP Costs ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Tier !! MP Cost !! Power Level
|-
| Level 1 || 2-4 MP || Basic
|-
| Level 2 || 6-10 MP || Moderate
|-
| Level 3 || 15-20 MP || Strong
|-
| Level 4 || 25-40 MP || Powerful
|}

== Experience and Leveling ==

=== Experience Formula ===

```
EXP Gained = Base EXP × (1 + Level Difference Bonus)
```

Level difference affects EXP:
* Fighting stronger enemies: Bonus EXP
* Fighting weaker enemies: Reduced EXP

=== Level Up Stats ===

Each character gains different stats per level:

{| class="wikitable"
! Character !! HP !! MP !! Power !! Guard !! Magic !! Speed
|-
| Wilme || +15 || +2 || +3 || +3 || +1 || +2
|-
| Lux || +12 || +6 || +2 || +2 || +3 || +2
|-
| Olvan || +14 || +4 || +3 || +3 || +2 || +1
|-
| Lejes || +10 || +8 || +1 || +1 || +4 || +2
|-
| Esuna || +11 || +7 || +1 || +2 || +3 || +3
|-
| Valsu || +10 || +9 || +1 || +1 || +4 || +2
|-
| Kamil || +13 || +5 || +2 || +2 || +2 || +3
|}

== Enemy Scaling ==

The 7th Saga is known for its rubber-banding enemy difficulty:

=== Scaling Formula ===

```
Enemy Level = Player Level + Region Modifier
Enemy Stats = Base Stats × (1 + (Enemy Level / 10))
```

This means enemies always stay challenging regardless of grinding.

=== Region Modifiers ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Region !! Modifier
|-
| Lemele Area || +0
|-
| Bone Area || +2
|-
| Zellis Area || +4
|-
| Dowaine Area || +6
|-
| Padal Area || +8
|-
| Patrof Area || +10
|-
| Final Areas || +12
|}

== Apprentice Battles ==

=== PvP Mechanics ===

When fighting other apprentices:
* Their level scales to yours
* They use their character abilities
* Defeating them takes their runes
* Some will join as partners

=== Apprentice AI ===

{| class="wikitable"
! Character !! AI Behavior
|-
| Wilme || Aggressive physical attacks
|-
| Lux || Balanced attacks and defense
|-
| Olvan || Defensive, occasional magic
|-
| Lejes || Heavy magic use
|-
| Esuna || Mix of attack and healing
|-
| Valsu || Healing focus, then attack
|-
| Kamil || Balanced, uses items
|}

== Escape Mechanics ==

=== Escape Rate ===

```
Escape Chance = (Party Speed / Enemy Speed) × 50%
Minimum: 10%
Maximum: 90%
```

Failed escape wastes the turn.

== Partner System ==

=== Partner Benefits ===

Having a partner provides:
* Combined HP pool in battle
* Shared turn (both can act)
* Combined rune effects
* Stat bonuses

=== Partner Commands ===

In two-character battles:
* Each character has separate commands
* Can coordinate attacks
* Both must be defeated to lose

== Item Usage ==

=== Battle Items ===

|-
| Potion 1 || Heal 30 HP || Single
|-
| Potion 2 || Heal 100 HP || Single
|-
| Potion 3 || Heal 250 HP || Single
|-
| M. Water || Restore 20 MP || Single
|-
| Mirror || Reflect magic once || Single
|-
| B. Agate || Cure all status || Single

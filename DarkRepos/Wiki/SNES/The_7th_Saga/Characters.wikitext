{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Protagonist !! Compatible Partners
|-
| Kamil || Olvan, Esuna, Valsu
|-
| Olvan || Kamil, Lux, Valsu
|-
| Esuna || Kamil, Valsu, Wilme
|-
| Wilme || Esuna, Lux, Lejes
|-
| Lux || Olvan, Wilme, Lejes
|-
| Valsu || Kamil, Olvan, Esuna
|-
| Lejes || Wilme, Lux (rarely others)
|}

Partners that refuse based on alignment:
* Good characters won't join Lejes
* Lejes won't join good characters
* Lux is neutral (mechanical)

== Rival Battles ==

AI rivals level up alongside the player, often faster in the US version. When encountered in towns, they may:
* Offer to join as partner
* Challenge you to battle
* Trade runes
* Attack unprovoked

'''Rival Difficulty Note:''' The US version has significantly buffed enemy/rival stats, making the game much harder than the Japanese "Elnard" version.

== Character-Specific Endings ==

Each character has a unique ending sequence based on their personality and goals:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Character !! Ending Theme
|-
| Kamil || Becomes knight captain, rebuilds kingdom
|-
| Olvan || Returns to dwarven homeland
|-
| Esuna || Becomes high priestess
|-
| Wilme || Returns to space
|-
| Lux || Seeks his creator
|-
| Valsu || Spreads peace teachings
|-
| Lejes || Achieves dark ambitions
|}

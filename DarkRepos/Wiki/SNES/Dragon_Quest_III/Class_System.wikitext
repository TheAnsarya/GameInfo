==Class System Overview==

Dragon Quest III features a robust class (vocation) system that allows characters to change their profession at [[Dharma Temple|Alltrades Abbey]]. Characters must reach level 20 before changing classes. Upon class change, the character's level resets to 1, but they retain a portion of their stats and all learned spells.

==Personality Data Structure==

Personality modifiers are stored at bank $C4, starting at $C40000.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Offset !! Size !! Description
|-
| $00 || 1 byte || Personality ID
|-

==Stat Growth Calculation==

The personality modifier is applied as a percentage to the base class growth rate:

<pre>
FinalGrowth = BaseClassGrowth * (100 + PersonalityModifier) / 100
</pre>

Example: A Soldier (high Str growth of ~3.5/level) with Macho personality (+20% Str):
<pre>
FinalStrGrowth = 3.5 * 120 / 100 = 4.2 per level
</pre>

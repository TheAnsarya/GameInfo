'''Final Fantasy Mystic Quest''' features a streamlined magic system with three categories of spells.

__TOC__

== Magic Overview ==

Magic is divided into three categories, each with its own charge pool. Each spell costs '''1 charge''' from its respective pool.

== Battle Strategy ==

=== Spell Usage ===

Since all spells cost 1 charge, strategy focuses on choosing the right spell for the situation rather than conserving charges.

'''Early Game (Foresta):'''
* Cure for healing
* Fire for damage

'''Mid Game (Aquaria-Fireburg):'''
* Blizzard for groups
* Match elements to weaknesses
* Heal for emergency

'''Late Game (Windia-Doom):'''
* Meteor for groups (non-elemental)
* Flare for single targets
* White for undead

=== Elemental Matching ===

* Always match spell element to enemy weakness for maximum damage
* Use non-elemental (Meteor) against enemies with no clear weakness

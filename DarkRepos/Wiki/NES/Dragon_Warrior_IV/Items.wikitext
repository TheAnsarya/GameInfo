This page documents the item system in Dragon Warrior IV for the NES.

== Overview ==

Dragon Warrior IV uses a single-byte item ID system supporting up to 128 unique items. The item data is distributed across multiple ROM banks, with item names, prices, stats, and equipment restrictions stored in separate tables.

== ROM Data Locations ==

{| class="wikitable"
